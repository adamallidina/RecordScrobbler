#Record Scrobbler

Record Scrobbler is a python based desktop application. It's purpose is to allow last.fm users to scrobble music which they listen to on their turntables.

Record Scrobbler is a work in progress and not ready for use yet, the README will be updated with a howto and usage examples once development has reached a usable stage.
